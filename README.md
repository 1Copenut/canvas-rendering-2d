# README

## Intro

I ❤️ charts and data. From the time I started in user interface design, I was visualizing complex data. What I **wasn't** doing was making it accessible. And that didn't sit quite right.

But the web is always moving forward, and now the technology has caught up, and I'm able to right some wrongs. This repo explores using the [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) API to draw charts that can be interacted with using a keyboard or screen reader. A premium will be placed on clear labeling, semantic markup, and good design practices for visual data.
