# README

I ❤️ charts and data. From the time I started in user interface design, I was visualizing complex data. What I **wasn't** doing was making it accessible. And that didn't sit quite right.

But the web is moving forward. Technology has caught up, and I'm able to right some wrongs. This repo uses the [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) API to draw charts that can be interacted with using a keyboard or screen reader. A premium will be placed on clear labeling, semantic markup, and good design practices for visual data.

## Getting started
All the steps you should need to try out the accessible charts demo.

1. Check to [make sure you have Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine
2. Check by opening a terminal window and typing `node --version`
3. If you have Node installed, you should see a message like "v16.x.x". I'm writing this demo using Node 16 long-term support (LTS).
4. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/1Copenut/canvas-rendering-2d/fork) to your local machine
5. In a terminal window, type the following commands minus the `$`
6. `$ cd /location/to/canvas-rendering-2d`
7. `$ npm install`
8. `$ npm run start`
9. You should now be able to view the landing page at **localhost:8080**. Click on any of the links to view an example chart.
